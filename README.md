# Pdf-GPT
Pdf-GPT designed by NVIDIA NIM  from the the model "meta/llama3-70b-instruct".
In this model we use Nvidia api key which gets integrated from the nvidia server which  reads the documents when we give a particular question which is related to the document.
We have use langchain to create a framework on which we created our llm model.

It is the most powerful llm model as it runs on gpu.
